# Mneme

As the greek word for memory, Mneme represents either one of the [3 original Muses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mneme) or the root
of [Mnemosyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemosyne), the goddess of Memory and mother of the [9 Olympian Muses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muses).

Memory is therefore recognized as necessary for the learning and mastering of all Arts and Sciences... just like
